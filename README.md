## 2.2.3 Take Detailed Notes
We highly recommend keeping a journal of:
- All the commands typed in at the command line, and their results
- What is installed via GUI installers

# Conda

Miniconda is a free minimal installer for conda. It is a small,
bootstrap version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the
packages they depend on, and a small number of other useful packages,
including pip, zlib and a few others. Use the conda install command to
install 720+ additional conda packages from the Anaconda repository.

# PostgresSQL

`$ sudo apt install postgresql-client`

`$ sudo apt install postgresql`

`$ ss -nlt` : "Once PostgreSQL Server has finished installing, you should be able to see it listening for incoming connections on port 5432. This is a good way to confirm that itâ€™s up and running as expected."

# Virtualenv

`$ pyenv install 3.10.0 && pyenv virtualenv 3.10.0 rhizome`
